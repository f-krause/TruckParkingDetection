# Overview

![Starting Image](data/assets/start-image.png)

This repository is based on a project conducted by Michael Fixl, Josef Hinterleitner, [Felix Krause](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-krause-7a643b222) and [Adrian Sei√ü](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-sei%C3%9F) at the Vienna University of Economics and Business in collaboration with [Trustbit](https://trustbit.tech/).

The notebooks above perform the following tasks:

0. Script to manually filter satellite images and labels based on a list of coordinates (of GeoPandas polygon type; coordinates of truck parking lots can be extracted from OpenStreetMap, e.g. via Google BigQuery)
1. Combine several white- and blacklists from manual filtering to one csv containing coordinates and an unique id
2. Create training data for object detection (XML file with pixel values of bounding box; object detection not in this repo yet)
3. Create training data for polygonal labels
    1. Save information in one JSON (necessary for instance segmentation with e.g. Mask R-CNN, not included in this repo)
    2. Save information as masks (necessary for algorithms of [Segmentation Models API](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models))
4. Train image segmentation models (U-Net, Linknet, FPN and PSPNet) in a simple baseline setting
5. Optimize the best performing model of notebook 4.
6. Final function, where one can enter coordinates (of a parking lot), and the function returns the (visual) parking lot prediction for this location
7. Final function but for public use (only one interactive code chunk)
